        <p>Well blow me down? Come show me how ye bury yer treasure, lad! That’s quite a cutlass ye got thar, what ye need is a good scabbard! Always be yourself, unless you can be a pirate. Then always be a pirate. And that was done without a single drop of rum… To err is human but to arr is pirate!!</p>
        <p>I’d love to drop anchor in your lagoon. There comes a time in most men’s lives where they feel the need to raise the Black Flag.</p>
        <p>I’d love to drop anchor in your lagoon. How’d you like to scrape the barnacles off of me rudder? That’s quite a cutlass ye got thar, what ye need is a good scabbard! Not all treasure is silver and gold Where there is a sea there are pirates. A pirate is a man that is weak to achieve but too strong to steal from even the greatest achiever.</p>

        <p>Yes, that is a hornpipe in my pocket and I am happy to see you. You’re drinking a Salty Dog? How’d you like to try the real thing? Yarrrr! there be ony two ranks of leader amongst us pirates! Captain and if your really notorious then it’s Cap’n! Now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be pirates. Always be yourself, unless you can be a pirate. Then always be a pirate. The average man will bristle if you say his father was dishonest, but he will brag a little if he discovers that his great- grandfather was a pirate. If ye thinks he be ready to sail a beauty, ye better be willin’ to sink with her. “I’ve got a jar of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?” “Why is the rum always gone?” Right from the Voyage og Noah, surviving was by sailing. Avast ye! and sail against the tides</p>
        <p>Have ya ever met a man with a real yardarm? Wanna shiver me timbers? That’s the finest pirate booty I’ve ever laid eyes on. Why is the rum gone? Suddenly you’re like a pirate, you’re 65 years old and you’ve got an ear- ring. A pirate is a man that is weak to achieve but too strong to steal from even the greatest achiever.</p>
        <p>Pardon me, but would ya mind if I fired me cannon through your porthole? What are YOU doing here? Yarrrr! there be ony two ranks of leader amongst us pirates! Captain and if your really notorious then it’s Cap’n! Life’s pretty good, and why wouldn’t it be? I’m a pirate, after all.</p>
        <p>Come on up and see me urchins. They don’t call me Long John because my head is so big. You’re drinking a Salty Dog? How’d you like to try the real thing? Let’s get together and haul some keel. Why is the rum gone? you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man sail away with my ship. Arrrrrrrr Without the messy paperwork.</p>
